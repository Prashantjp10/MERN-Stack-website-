              Clients are made integral part of our team while executing the
              projects. This makes the audacious task of the software
              development and execution much simpler and easier, in tune with
              the clientâ€™s expectation. At I-Link, based on the situation and
              need of the project, we follow one of the following software
              development methodologies. Agile software development is a set of
              principles for software development in which requirements and
              solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing,
              cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning,
              evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous
              improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to
              change. Agile itself has never defined any specific methods to
              achieve this, but many have grown up as a result and have been
              recognized as being 'Agile'.
